### expectation management in Tech Team

#### What
   When we talks about  expectation management , we mean we should set our goal to your boss/peer/subordinary:
    - why you do it 
    - how much will it impact the business 
    - what you can achieve 
    - what resource you will need
    - when you will get it done
    - what difficulty you will meet, will you able to solve them

   in some case, to your subordinary:
    - what you can do
    - more important: what you can achieve 


#### Why  
   Information are not transparent during we work, we might encount some isssue, some bugs  that we need to solve, and some unstalbe system to improve.
In the boss view, according to his rich exprience, he might think the problem need to be solved within some minutes/hours/days. But he might knows all the details, the difficulty you knows, so the estimate time you promise to solve the problem might not meeet his expection.
In some case, your boss may not relatively know your industry, he might juse wanna solve the problem ASAP.
Some how, we're not talking about your boss may not wrong or you might not right. 
In some case, your boss may not relatively know your industry, he might juse wanna solve the problem ASAP.
    So, we need to make a deal about the delivery: when will the system become stable, when will it bugless( although it sounds Mission Impossible)

#### How
  Find out a way what's most effective way to solve the problem right away, how to prevent loss right away.
  And make a plan how to improve it , stopping it happen again according to time ,and importancy -- this two factor deside priority.
  According to your resource, make a realitic plan. If this not satisfy, tell the boss what you need directly.

Last but not least, don't  report passive, always let the boss knows the procedure transparently.
